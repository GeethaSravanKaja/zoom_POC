## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Operational Rules
• Meeting End Time must be greater than or equal to Start Time

### 3.2 Reporting Logic
• Meeting Duration calculated as End Time minus Start Time
• Participant Attendance Duration calculated as Leave Time minus Join Time
• Total Account Usage aggregated from all user sessions within account
• Quality Metrics averaged over session duration for composite scores
• License Utilization calculated as assigned licenses divided by total licenses
• Room Utilization calculated as booked time divided by available time
• Webinar Attendance Rate calculated as Attendance Count divided by Registration Count
• Phone Call Success Rate calculated as completed calls divided by total attempts
• User Adoption Rate calculated as active users divided by total licensed users
• Cost per User calculated as total account cost divided by active users

### 3.3 Transformation Guidelines
• Convert all timestamps to UTC for consistent reporting across time zones
• Normalize phone numbers to E.164 format for international compatibility
• Standardize email addresses to lowercase for consistency
• Calculate derived metrics (duration, attendance rates, utilization percentages)
• Aggregate data by standard time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly)
• Apply data masking for sensitive information in non-production environments
• Implement data compression for long-term storage of historical data
• Standardize geographic location data to consistent coordinate systems
• Apply currency conversion using appropriate exchange rates for multi-currency accounts
• Normalize device information to standard classification schemes
