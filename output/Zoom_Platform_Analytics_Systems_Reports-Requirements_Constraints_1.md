16. **API_Call Entity:** call_id, endpoint, timestamp, user_id, response_code

### 2.2 Uniqueness Constraints
1. user_id must be unique across the User entity
2. meeting_id must be unique for each Meeting record
3. recording_id must be unique for each Recording
4. account_id must be unique for each Account
5. session_id must be unique for each Session
6. Combination of participant_id and meeting_id must be unique
7. API call_id must be unique for each API_Call record

### 2.3 Data Type Limitations
1. Numeric fields (duration, file_size, participant_count) must be non-negative integers
2. Boolean fields (is_host, is_recording_enabled) must be true/false values
3. Date/time fields must be valid timestamps
4. Email fields must contain valid email format
5. Percentage fields must be between 0 and 100
6. Quality scores must be within defined ranges (0-5 or 0-100 based on metric type)

### 2.4 Dependencies
1. Participant records depend on valid Meeting and User records
2. Recording records depend on valid Meeting records
3. Session records depend on valid User and Device records
4. Usage_Summary records depend on valid User records
5. Quality_Metric records depend on valid Session records
6. Dashboard access depends on valid User permissions

### 2.5 Referential Integrity
1. All foreign key relationships must maintain referential integrity
2. Cascade delete rules must be defined for parent-child relationships
3. Orphaned records must be prevented through proper constraint enforcement
4. Cross-entity references must be validated before data insertion

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 User Engagement Rules
1. Active users must have at least one session within the measurement period
2. User engagement scores must be calculated based on meeting participation frequency
3. Inactive users (no activity > 90 days) must be flagged for review
4. User role changes must be tracked and auditable

### 3.2 Meeting Performance Rules
1. Meeting duration must not exceed maximum allowed time per plan type
2. Participant limits must be enforced based on account plan restrictions
3. Recording storage must comply with account storage quotas
4. Meeting quality scores must be calculated using standardized algorithms

### 3.3 System Performance Rules
1. Response times must be measured and stored for all API calls
2. System availability must be calculated as uptime percentage
3. Performance degradation alerts must be triggered based on threshold violations
4. Resource utilization metrics must be captured at regular intervals

### 3.4 Data Processing Rules
1. Real-time data must be processed within 5 minutes of generation
2. Batch processing must complete within defined maintenance windows
3. Data aggregation must follow consistent calculation methodologies
4. Historical data must be preserved according to retention policies

### 3.5 Reporting Logic Rules

2. Access logs must be maintained for all data operations
3. Data retention must comply with regulatory requirements
4. Cross-border data transfer must follow applicable privacy laws

## 4. API Cost Calculation

### 4.1 Cost Structure
1. **Base API Call Cost:** $0.002 per request
2. **Data Volume Surcharge:** $0.001 per MB of response data
3. **Premium Endpoint Multiplier:** 2x for advanced analytics endpoints
4. **Bulk Operation Discount:** 15% reduction for batch requests >100 records

### 4.2 Zoom Platform Analytics API Cost Calculation
For this particular API implementation:
1. **Estimated Monthly API Calls:** 50,000 requests
2. **Average Response Size:** 2.5 MB per request
3. **Premium Endpoints Usage:** 30% of total calls
4. **Bulk Operations:** 20% of total calls

**Cost Breakdown:**
1. Standard API Calls (35,000): 35,000 × $0.002 = $70.00
2. Premium API Calls (15,000): 15,000 × $0.002 × 2 = $60.00
3. Data Volume Charges: 50,000 × 2.5 MB × $0.001 = $125.00
4. Bulk Operation Discount: (10,000 calls × $0.002 × 15%) = -$3.00

**Total Monthly API Cost:** $252.00

### 4.3 Cost Optimization Recommendations
1. Implement response caching to reduce redundant API calls
2. Use bulk operations where possible to leverage discount pricing
3. Monitor data volume to optimize response payload sizes
4. Schedule non-critical requests during off-peak hours if applicable

**Cost for this particular API Call to LLM model:** $252.00
