# Bronze Data Model Reviewer Document

## 1. Alignment with Conceptual Data Model

### 1.1 ✅ Covered Requirements

**Core Entity Coverage:**
- ✅ Users management (bz_users table) - Complete user profile information including email, name, phone, timezone, account type, and status tracking
- ✅ Meetings tracking (bz_meetings table) - Comprehensive meeting metadata including topic, type, timing, participant counts, and security settings
- ✅ Participant engagement (bz_participants table) - Detailed participant interaction data including join/leave times, device information, and feature usage
- ✅ Recording management (bz_recordings table) - Complete recording metadata including file information, download URLs, and access controls

- ✅ Participant session tracking with join/leave times

### 1.2 ❌ Missing Requirements

**Data Integrity Constraints:**
- ❌ No explicit PRIMARY KEY constraints defined on any tables

- ✅ TIMESTAMP_NTZ for temporal data ensuring timezone-naive consistency
- ✅ NUMBER for numeric values and durations with flexible precision
- ✅ BOOLEAN for flag fields (password_protected, recording_enabled, etc.)
- ✅ DATE for date-only fields (report_period_start, report_period_end)

**Comprehensive Field Coverage:**
- ✅ Complete user profile information matching source system structure
- ✅ Detailed meeting metadata including all Zoom platform settings
- ✅ Comprehensive participant interaction data for analytics
- ✅ Recording file information with download and security metadata
- ✅ Chat message content with sender/recipient tracking

**Audit Trail Support:**
- ✅ Source system tracking for data lineage
- ✅ Load timestamp preservation for ETL monitoring
- ✅ Update timestamp tracking for change data capture

### 2.2 ❌ Misaligned or Missing Elements

**Data Type Precision Issues:**
- ❌ NUMBER fields lack precision and scale specifications which may cause data truncation
- ❌ STRING fields without length constraints may impact query performance
- ❌ Missing VARIANT data type for semi-structured data that may exist in source

**Standardization Gaps:**
- ❌ Inconsistent field naming patterns across some tables
- ❌ Missing standardized error handling fields
- ❌ No data classification or sensitivity labels for PII fields

## 3. Best Practices Assessment

### 3.1 ✅ Adherence to Best Practices

**Naming Conventions:**
- ✅ Consistent "bz_" prefix for Bronze layer tables following medallion architecture
- ✅ Descriptive table and column names that clearly indicate purpose
- ✅ Clear schema organization with Bronze schema separation
- ✅ Snake_case naming convention for readability

**Data Warehouse Patterns:**
- ✅ Separate audit logging table for comprehensive process monitoring
- ✅ Consistent metadata columns (load_timestamp, update_timestamp, source_system) across all tables
- ✅ Proper temporal data handling with appropriate timestamp fields
- ✅ Bronze layer raw data preservation approach

**Snowflake Optimization:**
- ✅ Use of TIMESTAMP_NTZ for consistent timezone handling
- ✅ Appropriate native Snowflake data type selection
- ✅ IF NOT EXISTS clause for idempotent table creation
- ✅ AUTOINCREMENT usage in audit table for unique record identification

### 3.2 ❌ Deviations from Best Practices

**Performance Optimization Missing:**
- ❌ No clustering keys defined for large tables which will impact query performance
- ❌ Missing partitioning strategy for time-series data
- ❌ No search optimization service configuration for frequently filtered columns
- ❌ Missing table-level comments for documentation

**Data Governance Gaps:**
- ❌ No data classification or sensitivity labels for PII compliance
- ❌ Missing data retention policies definition
- ❌ No masking policies for sensitive data (email_address, phone_number, ip_address)
- ❌ Missing row access policies for data security

**Error Handling Deficiencies:**
- ❌ No default values for critical audit fields
- ❌ Missing comprehensive data validation rules
- ❌ No error handling procedures defined

## 4. DDL Script Compatibility

### 4.1 ✅ Snowflake SQL Compatibility

**Syntax Compliance:**
- ✅ Proper CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS syntax for idempotent operations
- ✅ Valid Snowflake native data types used throughout
- ✅ Correct schema qualification (Bronze.table_name) for namespace clarity
- ✅ AUTOINCREMENT usage in bz_audit_log table is valid Snowflake syntax
- ✅ Proper comment syntax and formatting

**Data Type Usage:**
- ✅ STRING instead of VARCHAR following Snowflake best practices
- ✅ TIMESTAMP_NTZ for timezone-naive timestamps ensuring consistency
- ✅ NUMBER for numeric values with flexible precision
- ✅ BOOLEAN for true/false values with proper handling
- ✅ DATE for date-only fields

### 4.2 ❌ Used any unsupported Snowflake features

**No Unsupported Features Detected:**
- ✅ All DDL syntax is compatible with Snowflake
- ✅ No external format references (Delta Lake, Spark-specific keywords)
- ✅ No deprecated Snowflake features used
- ✅ No invalid constructs present

**Missing Snowflake-Specific Optimizations:**
- ❌ No use of Snowflake-specific features like VARIANT for semi-structured data
- ❌ Missing clustering keys for performance optimization
- ❌ No time travel retention settings specified
- ❌ Missing secure views or masking policies for sensitive data

## 5. Identified Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

**1. Data Integrity Constraints Missing (Priority: HIGH)**
- **Issue**: No primary keys, foreign keys, or NOT NULL constraints defined
- **Impact**: Risk of data inconsistency, duplicate records, and referential integrity violations
- **Recommendation**: 
  ```sql
  -- Example for bz_users table
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.bz_users ADD CONSTRAINT pk_bz_users PRIMARY KEY (user_id);
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.bz_users ALTER COLUMN user_id SET NOT NULL;
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.bz_users ALTER COLUMN email_address SET NOT NULL;
  ```

**2. Performance Optimization Missing (Priority: HIGH)**
- **Issue**: Large tables without clustering keys will have poor query performance
- **Impact**: Slow query execution, increased compute costs, poor user experience
- **Recommendation**:
  ```sql
  -- Add clustering keys to high-volume tables
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.bz_meetings CLUSTER BY (meeting_id, start_time);
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.bz_participants CLUSTER BY (meeting_id, join_time);
  ```

### Medium Priority Improvements

**3. Data Type Precision (Priority: MEDIUM)**
- **Issue**: NUMBER fields lack precision and scale specifications
- **Impact**: Potential data truncation and inconsistent numeric handling
- **Recommendation**:
  ```sql
  -- Specify precision for numeric fields
  duration NUMBER(10,2),  -- For duration in minutes with decimal precision
  file_size NUMBER(15,0), -- For file sizes in bytes
  ```

**4. Data Governance Implementation (Priority: MEDIUM)**
- **Issue**: Missing PII masking and data classification
- **Impact**: Compliance risks and data security vulnerabilities
- **Recommendation**:
  ```sql
  -- Create masking policies for PII fields
  CREATE MASKING POLICY email_mask AS (val STRING) RETURNS STRING ->
    CASE WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('ANALYST_ROLE') THEN val
         ELSE REGEXP_REPLACE(val, '.+@', '*****@')
    END;
  ```

### Long-term Enhancements

**5. Advanced Monitoring and Alerting (Priority: LOW)**
- **Issue**: Basic audit logging without advanced monitoring
- **Impact**: Limited visibility into data quality and processing issues
- **Recommendation**: Implement data quality monitoring with automated alerting

**6. Documentation and Metadata Management (Priority: LOW)**
- **Issue**: Missing table and column comments
- **Impact**: Reduced maintainability and knowledge transfer difficulties
- **Recommendation**: Add comprehensive comments to all database objects

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Immediate - Week 1-2):**
1. Add primary key constraints to all tables
2. Implement NOT NULL constraints on critical fields
3. Add clustering keys to high-volume tables (bz_meetings, bz_participants)

**Phase 2 (Short-term - Week 3-4):**
1. Establish foreign key relationships between related tables
2. Implement data masking policies for PII fields
3. Add search optimization service for frequently filtered columns
4. Specify precision for NUMBER data types

**Phase 3 (Long-term - Month 2-3):**
1. Implement comprehensive data quality monitoring
2. Add advanced partitioning strategies for time-series data
3. Enhance documentation with table and column comments
4. Implement row-level security policies
