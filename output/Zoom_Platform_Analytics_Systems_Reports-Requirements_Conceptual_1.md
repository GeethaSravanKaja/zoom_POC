## 6. Common Data Elements

### Standardized Data Types
- **Timestamps**: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- **Identifiers**: UUID format for universal uniqueness
- **Duration**: Minutes as integer values
- **Percentages**: Decimal values (0.00 to 100.00)
- **Status Fields**: Enumerated values with predefined options

### Common Attributes Across Entities
- created_at: Record creation timestamp
- updated_at: Last modification timestamp
- status: Current state of the entity

## 7. API Cost Calculation Framework

### Cost Components

#### Storage Costs
- **Meeting Data**: $0.001 per meeting record per month
- **Recording Storage**: $0.05 per GB per month
- **Chat History**: $0.0001 per message per month
- **Quality Metrics**: $0.0005 per metric record per month

#### Processing Costs
- **Real-time Analytics**: $0.10 per 1000 API calls
- **Batch Processing**: $0.05 per 1000 records processed
- **Report Generation**: $0.25 per report generated
- **Data Export**: $0.15 per 1000 records exported

#### API Usage Costs
- **Standard API Calls**: $0.001 per call
- **Premium Analytics API**: $0.005 per call
- **Bulk Data API**: $0.10 per 10,000 records
- **Real-time Streaming**: $0.50 per hour per stream

### Cost Calculation Formula
```
Total Monthly Cost = 
  (Storage_Cost × Data_Volume) + 
  (Processing_Cost × Transaction_Volume) + 
  (API_Cost × API_Call_Volume) + 
  (Bandwidth_Cost × Data_Transfer_Volume)
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- Implement data archiving policies
- Use batch processing for non-real-time analytics
- Optimize API call patterns
- Implement caching mechanisms
- Monitor and alert on cost thresholds

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Phase 1**: Implement core entities (Meeting, User, Organization)
2. **Phase 2**: Add quality metrics and performance monitoring
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate advanced analytics and reporting capabilities
4. **Phase 4**: Implement cost optimization and governance features

## Data Governance Considerations

- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and other regional privacy regulations
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies by data type
- **Access Control**: Role-based access to sensitive analytics data
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of data access and modifications
- **Data Lineage**: Track data flow from source to reports
