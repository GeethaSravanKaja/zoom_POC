## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Operational Rules
- Meetings with duration < 1 minute are classified as test meetings
- Participants joining after meeting end are marked as invalid
- Quality scores below 3.0 trigger automatic alerts
- Users inactive for 90+ days are marked as dormant
- Engagement scores are recalculated daily for active users
- Productivity indices are updated weekly based on meeting outcomes
- Collaboration ratings consider cross-functional interaction patterns

### 3.2 Reporting Logic
- Monthly reports aggregate data by calendar month
- User activity reports exclude test meetings
- Quality reports focus on meetings with 2+ participants
- Engagement reports include trend analysis over time
- Productivity reports correlate meeting metrics with outcomes
- Predictive reports include confidence intervals and model accuracy

### 3.3 Transformation Guidelines
- Raw timestamps converted to user's local timezone for reporting
- Quality metrics normalized to 0-10 scale
- Engagement scores calculated using weighted interaction formula
- Productivity indices derived from meeting effectiveness algorithms
- Predictive features engineered from historical patterns
- Advanced KPIs computed using machine learning models

### 3.4 Data Retention Rules
- Meeting data retained for 7 years
- User activity logs retained for 3 years
- Quality metrics retained for 2 years

### 5.5 Monthly Cost Estimation Formula
```
Total Monthly Cost = 
  (Meeting Records × $0.001) +
  (User Records × $0.0005) +
  (Participant Records × $0.0002) +
  (Analytics Calculations × $0.002) +
  (Predictive Requests × $0.005) +
  (Advanced KPIs × $0.003) +
  (Real-time Queries × $0.01) +
  (Predictive Models × $0.02) +
  (Dashboard Updates × $0.005) +
  (Trend Analyses × $0.008)
  
Apply volume discount based on total API calls
