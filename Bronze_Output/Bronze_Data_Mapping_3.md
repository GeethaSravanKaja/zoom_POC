- **Batch Processing**: Batch ID tracking for processing management
- **Boolean Flags**: Business logic indicators for enhanced analytics

### Mapping Principles

1. **Data Preservation**: All source data fields are preserved in their original format
2. **Metadata Enrichment**: System-generated fields added for operational excellence
3. **Quality Assurance**: Data quality scores and validation flags included
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete lineage and processing history maintained
5. **Scalability**: Design supports high-volume data ingestion
6. **Snowflake Optimization**: Data types optimized for Snowflake performance
