✅ **Primary Key Implementation** - Surrogate keys (SK) properly implemented using IDENTITY columns for all dimension and fact tables, ensuring unique identification and referential integrity.

✅ **Foreign Key Relationships** - Comprehensive foreign key constraints defined between fact and dimension tables, maintaining referential integrity across the data model.

✅ **Temporal Data Handling** - Consistent timestamp handling with TIMESTAMP_NTZ data type, proper date/time dimension integration, and audit field implementation.

✅ **Business Key Preservation** - Original business keys from Bronze layer preserved alongside surrogate keys, enabling traceability and integration with source systems.

✅ **Data Consolidation Logic** - Effective consolidation of related Bronze tables (e.g., bz_users + bz_user_account → DIM_USER) with proper attribute mapping and deduplication.

✅ **Dimensional Modeling** - Proper implementation of star schema design with fact tables containing metrics and dimension tables containing descriptive attributes.

✅ **Audit Field Consistency** - Standardized audit fields (RECORD_SOURCE, LOAD_DATE, LAST_UPDATED, HASH_KEY) implemented across all tables for data lineage tracking.

### 2.2 ❌ Red Tick: Misaligned or Missing Elements

❌ **Incomplete Bronze Coverage** - 2 out of 24 Bronze tables (bz_support_tickets, bz_audit_table) not transformed to Silver layer, representing 8.3% data loss.

❌ **Missing Data Quality Constraints** - Insufficient check constraints for business rule validation, email format validation, positive number constraints, and enumerated value validation.

❌ **Incomplete Metadata Preservation** - Some Bronze layer metadata fields not carried forward to Silver layer, potentially losing important operational context.

❌ **Limited Data Validation Rules** - Missing comprehensive data validation logic for cross-table consistency checks and business rule enforcement.
