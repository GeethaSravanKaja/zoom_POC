## 5. Identified Issues and Recommendations

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

**1. Performance Optimization Missing (Priority: CRITICAL)**
- **Issue**: Large tables (Bz_Meetings, Bz_Participants, Bz_Chat_Messages) without clustering keys
- **Impact**: Severe query performance degradation, increased compute costs, poor user experience
- **Recommendation**: 
  ```sql
  -- Add clustering keys to high-volume tables
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Meetings CLUSTER BY (meeting_id, start_time);
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Participants CLUSTER BY (meeting_id, join_time);
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Chat_Messages CLUSTER BY (meeting_id, message_timestamp);
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Data_Quality_Metrics CLUSTER BY (table_name, check_timestamp);
  ```

**2. Data Governance Implementation Gap (Priority: CRITICAL)**
- **Issue**: PII fields identified but no masking policies implemented in DDL
- **Impact**: Compliance violations, data security risks, regulatory penalties
- **Recommendation**:
  ```sql
  -- Create masking policies for PII fields
  CREATE MASKING POLICY email_mask AS (val STRING) RETURNS STRING ->
    CASE WHEN CURRENT_ROLE() IN ('DATA_ANALYST', 'DATA_SCIENTIST') THEN val
         ELSE REGEXP_REPLACE(val, '.+@', '*****@')
    END;
  
  -- Apply masking policies
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Users ALTER COLUMN email_address SET MASKING POLICY email_mask;
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Users ALTER COLUMN phone_number SET MASKING POLICY phone_mask;
  ```

**3. Data Integrity Constraints Missing (Priority: HIGH)**
- **Issue**: No primary keys, foreign keys, or comprehensive NOT NULL constraints
- **Impact**: Data inconsistency, duplicate records, referential integrity violations
- **Recommendation**:
  ```sql
  -- Add primary key constraints
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Users ADD CONSTRAINT pk_bz_users PRIMARY KEY (user_id);
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Meetings ADD CONSTRAINT pk_bz_meetings PRIMARY KEY (meeting_id);
  
  -- Add foreign key constraints
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Meetings ADD CONSTRAINT fk_meetings_host 
    FOREIGN KEY (host_id) REFERENCES Bronze.Bz_Users(user_id);
  ```

### Medium Priority Improvements

**4. Advanced Monitoring Implementation (Priority: MEDIUM)**
- **Issue**: Data quality metrics table exists but no automated monitoring processes
- **Impact**: Manual data quality monitoring, delayed issue detection
- **Recommendation**:
  ```sql
  -- Create stream for change data capture
  CREATE STREAM Bronze.bz_meetings_stream ON TABLE Bronze.Bz_Meetings;
  
  -- Create task for automated data quality checks
  CREATE TASK Bronze.data_quality_monitor
    WAREHOUSE = COMPUTE_WH
    SCHEDULE = '5 MINUTE'
  AS
    INSERT INTO Bronze.Bz_Data_Quality_Metrics (...)
    SELECT ... FROM Bronze.Bz_Meetings WHERE ...;
  ```

**5. Search Optimization Configuration (Priority: MEDIUM)**
- **Issue**: Frequently filtered columns without search optimization
- **Impact**: Slower query performance on filter operations
- **Recommendation**:
  ```sql
  -- Add search optimization service
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Users ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (email_address, user_id);
  ALTER TABLE Bronze.Bz_Meetings ADD SEARCH OPTIMIZATION ON (meeting_id, topic, start_time);
  ```

### Long-term Enhancements

**6. Advanced Security Implementation (Priority: LOW)**
- **Issue**: No row-level security policies for multi-tenant data access
- **Impact**: Potential unauthorized data access across organizational boundaries
- **Recommendation**: Implement row access policies based on user roles and data ownership

**7. Cost Optimization (Priority: LOW)**
- **Issue**: No resource monitors or automatic clustering for cost control
- **Impact**: Potentially high compute costs without proper optimization
- **Recommendation**: Implement resource monitors and automatic clustering policies
