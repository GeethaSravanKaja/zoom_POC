# Silver Data Model Reviewer
## Zoom Platform Analytics Systems - Silver Layer Physical Data Model Review

---

## 1. Alignment with Conceptual Data Model

### 1.1 ✅ Green Tick: Covered Requirements

✅ **Core Business Entities Present:**
- sv_users, sv_meetings, sv_participants, sv_feature_usage, sv_webinars, sv_support_tickets, sv_licenses, sv_billing_events, sv_data_quality_errors, sv_process_audit
- All primary entities from the conceptual model (users, meetings, participants, error/audit) are present and mapped to Silver tables.
- Metadata columns for governance and lineage are included as per conceptual requirements.

✅ **Schema Alignment:**
- Silver tables preserve all columns from Bronze layer, ensuring lineage and traceability.
- Data types are standardized and Snowflake-compatible (STRING, NUMBER, DATE, TIMESTAMP_NTZ).
- Table names use 'sv_' prefix for Silver layer consistency.

### 1.2 ❌ Red Tick: Missing Requirements

❌ **Logical Model Attributes Not Explicitly Present:**
- Some logical/conceptual attributes (e.g., user_type, account_status, meeting_type, participant_name) are present in logical model but are mapped to source-aligned columns in Silver layer (e.g., user_type → plan_type, account_status → record_status).
- No explicit mapping for some conceptual relationships (e.g., host_email in Si_Meetings vs host_id in sv_meetings).

❌ **Omission of IDs in Logical Model:**
- Logical model omits IDs per Silver rules, but physical model retains them for lineage; this is intentional but worth noting.

---

## 2. Source Data Structure Compatibility

### 2.1 ✅ Green Tick: Aligned Elements

✅ **All Bronze Columns Preserved:**
- Every column from Bronze tables is present in Silver tables, as per design principles.
- Data type mappings are correct (STRING, NUMBER, DATE, TIMESTAMP_NTZ).

✅ **Metadata and Audit Columns:**
- load_timestamp, update_timestamp, source_system, load_date, update_date, data_quality_score, record_status present for governance.

✅ **Error and Audit Tables:**
- sv_data_quality_errors and sv_process_audit provide centralized monitoring and lineage, as required.

### 2.2 ❌ Red Tick: Misaligned or Missing Elements

❌ **No Business Logic Transformations:**
- Silver layer intentionally does not apply business logic transformations; all source data is preserved, but this means some conceptual mappings are not direct.

❌ **Some Conceptual Relationships Not Explicitly Modeled:**
- E.g., host_email in conceptual/logical model is mapped to host_id/email in physical model; participant_name is not present, only user_id and participant_id.

---

## 3. Best Practices Assessment

### 3.1 ✅ Green Tick: Adherence to Best Practices

✅ **Snowflake SQL Compatibility:**
- All DDL scripts use supported Snowflake features and datatypes.
- Clustering keys are defined for performance optimization.
- No unsupported constraints, triggers, or features.

✅ **Governance and Lineage:**
- Metadata columns for audit, quality, and lineage are present in every table.
- Error and audit tables are well-defined for monitoring.

✅ **Schema Evolution Support:**
- Update scripts for schema evolution are included (examples for adding columns, changing datatypes, adding new tables).

### 3.2 ❌ Red Tick: Deviations from Best Practices

❌ **No Constraints or Triggers:**
- No primary/foreign key constraints or triggers (per Snowflake limitations and Silver layer rules).
- Data quality scoring is implemented by ETL, not enforced in DDL.

❌ **No Data Masking or Row-Level Security:**
- Sensitive data is not masked; security must be handled at application level.

---

## 4. DDL Script Compatibility

### 4.1 ✅ Snowflake SQL Compatibility

✅ All CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE statements are Snowflake SQL compatible.
✅ Supported datatypes (STRING, NUMBER, DATE, TIMESTAMP_NTZ) are used throughout.
✅ Clustering keys are defined using supported syntax.

### 4.2 ❌ Used any unsupported Snowflake features

❌ No unsupported features used; triggers and constraints are omitted as per Snowflake best practices and Silver layer rules.

---

## 5. Identified Issues and Recommendations

### Issues
- Some conceptual/logical attributes are mapped to source-aligned columns; documentation should clarify these mappings for downstream users.
- Relationships (e.g., host_email vs host_id) should be documented for lineage and reporting clarity.
- No constraints or business logic validation in DDL; recommend implementing these in ETL or reporting layer.
- Security and masking for sensitive fields should be addressed at application or reporting layer.

### Recommendations
- Enhance documentation to clarify attribute mappings and relationships between conceptual/logical and physical models.
- Consider adding business logic validation and data quality checks in ETL pipelines.
- Implement security and masking for sensitive fields in reporting or application layer.
- Continue to use schema evolution scripts for future changes and maintain version control.

## Conclusion

The Silver layer physical data model for Zoom Platform Analytics Systems is well-aligned with the Bronze source data, conceptually complete for core business entities, and fully compatible with Snowflake SQL best practices. All required tables and columns are present, with standardized data types and comprehensive metadata for governance and lineage. Minor deviations from conceptual/logical models are intentional for source alignment, but should be documented for clarity. No unsupported Snowflake features are used, and schema evolution is supported. Security and business logic validation should be handled outside the DDL scripts. Overall, the model is ready for production use with recommended documentation and ETL enhancements.
