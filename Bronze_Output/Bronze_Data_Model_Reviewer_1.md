### 1.2 ❌: Missing Requirements

**No Critical Missing Requirements Identified**: The Bronze physical data model comprehensively covers all entities and attributes defined in the conceptual data model. All 16 core business entities and their respective attributes have been successfully implemented.

## 2. Source Data Structure Compatibility

### 2.1 ✅: Aligned Elements

**Snowflake-Optimized Data Types**: All tables utilize appropriate Snowflake-native data types ensuring optimal performance and compatibility:
- **STRING**: Used for text fields with flexible length accommodation (user names, descriptions, titles)
- **NUMBER**: Applied to all numeric fields including integers and decimals (counts, measurements, scores)
- **BOOLEAN**: Implemented for binary indicators (flags, permissions, status indicators)
- **DATE**: Used for date-only fields (creation dates, contract dates, expiration dates)
- **TIMESTAMP_NTZ**: Applied to datetime fields without timezone for consistent temporal tracking

**Source System Integration Readiness**: All tables include comprehensive metadata columns for source system tracking:
- **load_timestamp**: Enables data lineage tracking and load monitoring
- **update_timestamp**: Supports change data capture and incremental processing
- **source_system**: Facilitates multi-source data integration and source identification

**Raw Data Preservation**: Bronze layer design maintains source data integrity with minimal transformation, preserving original data structure and values for downstream processing.

**Flexible Schema Design**: Table structures accommodate varying source data formats and support null handling for optional fields, ensuring robust data ingestion capabilities.

### 2.2 ❌: Misaligned or Missing Elements

**Limited Documentation**: DDL scripts lack comprehensive table and column comments that would enhance understanding of source data mapping and business context.

**Missing Compression Specifications**: Tables do not include explicit compression hints which could optimize storage for large-volume data ingestion from Zoom platform sources.

## 3. Best Practices Assessment

### 3.1 ✅: Adherence to Best Practices

**Bronze Layer Design Principles**: The model correctly implements Bronze layer best practices:
- **Raw Data Preservation**: Tables maintain source data in original format without business logic transformation
- **Minimal Processing**: Only essential data type conversions and metadata additions applied
- **Audit Trail Implementation**: Comprehensive metadata columns support data governance and lineage tracking
- **Idempotent Loading Support**: Structure enables reprocessing capabilities for data recovery scenarios

**Snowflake Optimization**: Implementation leverages Snowflake-specific features:
- **Appropriate Data Types**: Efficient data type selection for storage and query optimization
- **No Unnecessary Constraints**: Correctly omits primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints for Bronze layer flexibility
- **Partition-Ready Structure**: Date and timestamp columns support future partitioning strategies
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture supports growing data volumes from Zoom platform expansion

**Data Governance Standards**: Model implements comprehensive governance practices:
- **Consistent Metadata**: Standard metadata columns across all 17 tables
- **Source Traceability**: Clear source system identification for data lineage
- **Temporal Tracking**: Load and update timestamps enable change tracking

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Bronze.bz_user_account (
       -- table definition
   );
   ```

2. **Absent Table Documentation**: Add comprehensive table and column comments for better maintainability
   ```sql
   COMMENT ON TABLE Bronze.bz_user_account IS 'Bronze layer table storing raw user account data from Zoom platform API';
   ```

3. **Missing Compression Specifications**: Implement compression hints for storage optimization
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE Bronze.bz_usage_analytics (
       -- columns
   ) CLUSTER BY (load_timestamp);
