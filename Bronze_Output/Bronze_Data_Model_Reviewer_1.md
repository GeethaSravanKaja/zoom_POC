# Bronze Data Model Reviewer - Zoom Platform Analytics

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive evaluation of the Bronze layer physical data model for the Zoom Platform Analytics project implemented in Snowflake. The Bronze layer follows the Medallion architecture pattern and serves as the raw data ingestion layer for the data warehouse.

## 1. Alignment with Conceptual Data Model

### 1.1 ✅ Covered Requirements

✅ **Core Entity Coverage**
- Bz_Users: User management and profile data with comprehensive fields including user_id, email_address, user_name, account_type, status, timezone, department, job_title, phone_number, company, created_at, last_login_time, etc.
- Bz_Meetings: Meeting metadata and configurations with meeting_id, host_user_id, meeting_topic, start_time, duration, timezone, agenda, join_url, password fields
- Bz_Webinars: Webinar-specific information with webinar_id, host_user_id, webinar_topic, start_time, duration, registration_url
